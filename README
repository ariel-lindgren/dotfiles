Just keeping my configuration files on the net.

Install
=======

Check this out to ~/Personal/bin/dotfiles and then:

cp dotfiles/bash/bashrc ~/.bashrc
cp dotfiles/bash/bash_profile ~/.bash_profile 

Bash
====

Bash uses vcprompt, that can be downloaded from http://vc.gerg.ca/hg/vcprompt and then needs to be compiled. After compiling, copy it to your personal bin directory
